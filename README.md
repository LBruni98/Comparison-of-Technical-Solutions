# Comparison of Technical Solutions

Technical solutions can be compared in a variety of ways. The reason for the comparison of these solutions is because that during development, problems will arise so but there are many solutions available for that problem, so each solution would have to be looked at in order to best determine which will work for the current problem. One common method of comparison is Effective analysis.

### Effective Analysis
In Effective Analysis, the problem is used as a starting point, laying out the factors that should be addressed when looking into different solutions. For a product, there are set of non-functional qualities associated with it, which are safety, security, reliability, etc. whereas the functional qualities are along the lines of the system's purpose, to help understand the requirements in wider system contexts.

Along with assessing the effectiveness of the solution, systems engineers must also compare the given effectiveness with the limitations of costs and timescale in place. Here, the best solution is determined within said limitations where if one is effective, this solution can be proposed. However, should the solution prove to be ineffective, then it is necessary to return back to the problem at hand.

### Maturity and Support
It is important to consider how well established, noting how well made the product is, seeing the support between systems and if the product meets the clientâ€™s requirements. The products release can create any impression on the customer depending on the quality of the product.

In regards to support, during the creation of the product, it is important that to ensure that the product has essential support set up for the user. The product could suffer should the support be absent from the product, where the users may have issues and cannot contact anyone to help fix the product.
